# Autocrop

A simple web app that crops images. You can try it [here](https://kylejlin.github.io/autocrop).

The app automatically crops out as much as it can without losing any visible pixels (i.e., pixels with a non-zero alpha value).

You can upload a single image or a ZIP file containing multiple images.
